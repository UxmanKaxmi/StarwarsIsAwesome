# StarwarsIsAwesome P.S I Still love the prequels :D

A sample react-native project.

Few Notes

- Had to disable hermes because because the final release was not getting built.(RN 0.61 is still buggy)
- Couldn't compile the project for iOS because I did not have access to a mac. Although it shouldnt have any problems. I don't remember using any platform specific code or plugin.
- APK is present in the root directory.
- There are still some UI tweaks that needs to be tinkered with but due to the fact that I still have a full time job and I the given time frame was limited. I couldnt complete it.
